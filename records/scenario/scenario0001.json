Alternatively you can brows to **Alerts**, Click **Execute** and select **1 - Create False Positive Alert**\n\n- Once the alert is created, leave it for some time to allow the enrichment playbooks to be completed, then set the status to **Investigating** so the acknowledgment SLA will be computed\n- Inspect the various parsed email field such as Body and Headers \n- Run Investigation Playbook **Phishing Alert Enrichment and Investigation**\n- Notice The Alert Description, the email is tagged **Internal**\n- No malicious indicators found\n- The alert is closed as a false positive with a closure note: *Alert closed as False Positive, No Malicious component found*\n\n#### 4.2) True Positive Alert: **Fw: Vulnerability Patching Instructions**\n\nSimilar to the first alert, select **2 - Create True Positive Phishing Email**\n\n- Once the alert is created, leave it for some time to allow the enrichment playbooks to be completed\n\n> The malicious indicators are fetched from a CTI, Sometimes all indicators are false positives. You will need to run the step again until you get at least one malicious indicator\n\n- Set the status to **Investigating** so the acknowledgment SLA will be computed\n- Inspect the various parsed email field such as Body and Headers \n- Run Investigation Playbook **Phishing Alert Enrichment and Investigation**\n- Open the Playbook logs and follow the execution of the above playbook\n- Email Indicators are extracted and rated, notice the several of them with bad reputation\n- The executed playbook will escalate the alert automatically due to the malicious indicators. The alert will be closed for the remaining case investigation will be carried out as an incident by a T2 analyst\n- Browse to **Correlations > Incidents** and open the newly escalated incident\n- As T2 Analyst start the Incident Management by setting the Incident Status to : **In Progress** and its Phase status to : **Confirmation**\n- Browse to Indicators Tab and review the malicious Indicators, there are few of them\n- Expand the Incident description and notice the email origin, check if any of the targeted users is a high profile one. Users Active Directory details can be found at **Correlations >  Users**\n- Open the file Attachment indicator which looks like: **Password_Update_Guide_XXXX.docx** set its reputation based on the file content displayed on its File Preview field\n- Notice there no reputation is found for the file (0 day?), so it's risk factor has to be determined manually. Identify the indicator risk, if high set the Reputation to **Malicious**\n- If the case is confirmed True Positive browse to Incident module, set the Phase to **Eradication** and use the Execute button to run the remediation Playbook **Phishing Incident Response**\n- Notice how the email sender is blocked on the email gateway and the phishing email is deleted from all recipients mailboxes.\n\n> Now to be sure none of the recipients have actually opened the email and got the asset infected we will hunt for threats in FortiSIEM using the extracted indicators. the presence of the extracted indicators (from various events such as NGFW, EDR...etc) indicates the source asset has been infected\n\n- To run threat hunting playbook, select all indicators in the Incident Indicators TAB (use the select all button), then **execute > Hunt Indicators on FortiSIEM** when an indicator is found its TLP turns to **Red**\n- Browse to **Correlations > Hunts** and check the Source Data of each hunt which is the definitive proof the source asset has been infected\n- Quarantine the Asset in **Correlations > Assets** by running the playbook **Quarantine Infected Assets** from the execute button after selecting the asset\n\n> Even though the infected assets have been quarantined they remain infected. A manual task for recovery is created. Check it in the Tasks TAB\n\n- Once the tasks marked: **Completed** set the phase to **Aftermath** and close the incident by setting the status to **Resolved**. You will have to provide some info:\n  - Resolution: *Email Sender blocked on SEG, Malicious email deleted from all Mailboxes, infected Asset quarantined and recovered*\n  - Next Steps: *Create a KB entry for future reference*\n  - Incident Summary: *4 employees were targeted with a spear phishing attack, one of them detonated the malicious code (dricardo) and got his asset infected. incident response completed*\n\n- Click on **Generate Incident Summary Report** and open it once it's generated (takes a couple of minutes)\n\n#### 4.3) Fully automated case management with true Positive Alert: **Fw: Vulnerability Patching Instructions**\n\nSimilar to the first alert, select **3 - Create True Positive Phishing Email - Fully Automated** to create the 3rd alert. This Alert is not meant for a detailed walk through but rather a demonstration how the previous alert case management can be fully automated\n\n  - Open the alert, check the playbooks logs to track all the executed ones. \n  - Open the escalated record and check all the executed playbooks for the incident, indicators and assets.\n  - Notice all time metrics to see how long the automated process took\n\n#### 4.4) Dashboard\n\n- Browse to **Automation > Playbooks > 12 - Solution Pack Advanced Phishing** then locate and run the playbook: **4 - Create Phishing Demo Records** to populate the system with records which is useful for this step. Keep in mind this process might take few minutes.\n- Browse to Dashboard and select **Phishing Case Management**. Walk through the different widgets",

While most access is managed by IAM\/SSO several systems (especially legacy ones) still require local configuration to grant access for the new users or disable access for those who left.\nFortiSOAR Employee On\/Off Boarding solution pack helps automating this process by provisioning the access for new employees on the systems they have access to and disabling that access for the ones leaving the organization.\nThe mapping of each user access scope is done via Active Directory, where the group object holds the list of resources the members of the group can access.\nTypically user provisioning order comes from HR, in this simulation we assume it comes via Email. The required attributes for new users are:\n\n- Username\n- Group\n- Title\n\nFortiSOAR will: \n - Create the user on *Active Directory*\n - Create a mailbox for the user on *Microsoft Exchange*\n - Read the group access scope from *Active Directory* and provision access for the user on all systems part of the above scope\n\n > The group\/resources mapping is managed via the *Info* field of the group definition within *Active Directory*. the field contains the CSV of UUIDs of the management playbooks for the resources within the scope of the group. As an example, if the group grants access to SSH\/Server1 and MySQL\/Server2 the info field would look like: `9c827fcf-53bd-403a-b3bf-406f1a27d9d8,0d11f906-15ea-4aa9-a665-405cd44f061f` \n\nIf the action is to **deprovision** similar logic is applied except the action would be either to disable the user or delete it depending on the target system\n\n## 2) Prerequisites\n\n### 2.1) Generic Prerequisites:\n- Incident Response Content Pack: `yum install -y fsr-ir-content-pack.x86_64`\n\n### 2.2) For Simulation mode (Fake mock data):\n- Make sure your global variable: `Demo_mode` is set to `true` (Playbook editors > Tools > Global Variables)\n- Make sure your global variable: `EOF_SYS_User` is set to a username of your choice (Playbook editors > Tools > Global Variables). The variable holds the name of the newly provisioned or deprovisioned user\n- Make sure your global variable: `EOF_DB_User` is set to a username of your choice (Playbook editors > Tools > Global Variables)\n- FortiSOAR SOC Simulator Connector configured (1.0.9+)\n- It is recommended to have a working SMTP connector to receive tasks notifications\n\n### 2.3) For Live mode (Real data):\n- MS Exchange\/SMTP Connectors configured with your MS Exchange parameters (To receive instruction emails and send notifications)\n- AD Connector configured with your DC parameters (To run AD related actions)\n- MySQL\/SSH server(s) to act as resources\n\n> All Credentials used with the above connectors must have the required privileges to perform the actions they are meant to do (add user, disable user...etc)\n\n> You can customize the use case for your environment by adding 3 playbooks for each service: Provision, Deprovision , Management the latter is only used as a wrapper for the first two. Open any examples of the existing services to see how is it done\n\n\n### 3) Installation\/Deployment:\n- Download the repo's zip from this page, click on: **Code > Download ZIP** and save the ZIP file to your workstation\n- Open FortiSOAR import wizard located at: **Settings > Import Wizard**. Click on ![Import From File](import_from_file.png)\n- Drag and drop the zip file you downloaded and follow the wizard\n\n### 4) Simulation Steps:\n#### 4.1) For Simulation mode (Fake mock data):\n- Edit global variables: EOF_SYS_User and EOF_DB_User and populate them with names of your choice\n- Browse to Simulations, select the scenario and click **Run scenario**\n- (4) Alerts will be created at 30 seconds interval:\n    - System user Onboarding\n    - System user Offboarding\n    - DBA user Onboarding\n    - DBA user Offboarding\n- For Each alert track the associated playbooks to see what services are being provisioned based on the group defined in the user provisioning email request \n\n#### 4.2) For Live mode (Real data):\n- To Onboard a user send an email to your FortiSOAR mailbox with:\n    - Subject: user ... onboarding\n    - body:\n```\nUsername: ad_username_to_create\nGroup: ad_group\nTitle: job_title\n```\n- To Offboard a user send an email to your FortiSOAR mailbox with:\n    - Subject: user ... offboarding\n    - body:\n```\nUsername: ad_username_to_create\nGroup: ad_group\n```\n- Make sure the groups your users belong to have the appropriate management playbooks UUIDs in their info attribute in CSV format\n\n\n",
